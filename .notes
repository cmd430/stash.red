  ! nginx rewrite for old urls !
  server {
    server_name direct.stash.red;

    location / {
      rewrite ^ $scheme://stash.red/f$request_uri permanent;
    }

    listen 80;
  }

    - `/f/:id` for files
    - `/f/:id.:ext` file direct files
    - `/a/:id` for albums
    - `/u/:username` for users
